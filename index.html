                <p>Good food hygiene can prevent the transmission of pathogens responsible for many food borne diseases. Governments, industry and consumers have a shared responsibility in ensuring the safety of food. These are “Five keys to safer food”, which were developed to educate safe food handling behaviours to all consumers and food handlers.</p>

                <p>Cleanliness is essential in preventing foodborne illnesses. Always wash your hands before handling food, after using the toilet, and after touching pets or raw food. Clean surfaces, utensils, and equipment thoroughly to avoid cross-contamination from harmful microorganisms that may be present in soil, water, or raw foods.</p>

                <p>Avoid cross-contamination by keeping raw foods, especially meat, poultry, and seafood, separate from cooked and ready-to-eat foods. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw and cooked items to prevent the transfer of harmful bacteria from raw to safe foods.</p>

                <img src="https://wpcdn.web.wsu.edu/extension/uploads/sites/45/2016/03/cook.jpg" alt="Cook thoroughly">
                <p>Proper cooking kills harmful microorganisms. Cook food to the appropriate temperature, especially meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood. Use a food thermometer when necessary, and make sure that soups and stews reach boiling point. Avoid partially cooked foods, especially when reheating.</p>

                <p>Bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature. Keep hot foods hot (above 60°C) and cold foods cold (below 5°C). Do not leave cooked food at room temperature for more than two hours. Refrigerate promptly and thaw frozen food safely in the fridge, not on the counter.</p>

                <p>Safe food preparation starts with clean water and quality ingredients. Use potable water for cooking and cleaning, and select fresh, wholesome foods. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly and avoid food past its expiry date or with signs of spoilage.</p>
